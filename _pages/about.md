Thanks for visiting my website! I am a last-year PhD candidate in Political Science at Freie Universisät Berlin (on the job market). I also work as a Predoctoral researcher at a research project on [Digital governance in China](https://www.digitalgovernancechina.eu/) funded by European Research Council at the same university. 

I have a deep passion for *interdisciplinary* approaches to studying complex questions with profound societal and political implications in the digital era, both at domestic and international level. My research interests centre on various aspects of the interplay between politics and digitalization, including the macro-level transformation of political structure and institution in modern autocracies and democracies, and the micro-levle interaction between the psychological dimension (esp. affect and emotion) and digital-enabled political control (aka. digital control). My dissertation project examines the origins, mechanisms, and consequences of digital authoritariansim through the lens of human emotion. I use a rich methodological toolkit in my daily research, including computational multimodal analysis of text, image and video, survey experiment, and ethnographic fieldwork (e.g. interviews, documentation, participant observation).

Outside research you will most likely find me in the gym 🏋🏻‍♀️, jogging🏃🏻‍♀️‍➡️, learning French and Russian, traveling 🥾, or experimenting with a new receipt 👩🏻‍🍳.
