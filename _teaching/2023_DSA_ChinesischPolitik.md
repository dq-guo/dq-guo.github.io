Together with Anton Bogs (PhD candidate in Political Science at FUB), we led a two-week intensive summer course on Chinese politics to a group of sixteen high school students from all over Germany at [SchülerAkademie China](https://www.schuelerakademie-china.de/). The course was designed to introduce the basics about Chinese political system since 1949, from a political science disciplinary angle, and covered both domestic and international issues. The course was taught in German.
